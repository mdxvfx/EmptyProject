Folder Name: UE5

This folder is where the main project scene should
be stored as an Unreal Engine Project.

The UE scene should have the same name as the overall
project so you will end up with a folder structure like this:

<PROJECTNAME>/UE5/<PROJECTNAME>

Only the files which are included as part of the Unreal
scene should be stored here.  Models and assets created
for the project should be stored outside of this folder
as Unreal will automatically copy the data into the project
when assets are imported.
