Folder Name: REF

This folder is used to hold all REFerence materials.

This includes any documents created during the development of the concept
by the project team as well as materials gathered from external sources.

Subfolders:
	__PRE
		This will contain all PREproduction materials generated
		by the project team.  This includes scripts, concept sketches
		Storyboards, Animatics, Previs etc.

	_PROD
		This will contain all PRODuction materials used as reference
		for the project team or the tutors.  This includes test
		renders, lookdev images, playblasts, Behind The Scenes (BTS),
		review / feedback annotations etc

	POST
		This will contain all POSTproduction materials used as reference
		such as colour grading tests, test renders, Work In Progress (WIP)
		video edits etc.  These are *example* images and videos for review
		by the project team and tutors.  That means all videos and images
		should be lower quality, smaller files for REFerence only.
		Final renderings of the finished project should end up in the 
		<PROJECTNAME>/DCC/comp folder.
