Version 1.0 j.cox@mdx.ac.uk AUG 2023

Folder Name: DCC

This folder is used to hold all original CG materials
created by the project team using Digital Content Creation tools.

Subfolders:
	char
		This will contain CHARacter models and assets.  This could
		either be character/creature sculpts created for the project
		or Animation files linking a (third party) rig from the ASSETS folder.
		MoCap recordings and Motion Edits should also be stored here.

	comp
		This will contain COMPosites made from rendered or filmed video.
		Typically this will be POSTproduction edits made from playblasts
		or final rendered passes generated by the main project scene.
		However, this should also contain intermediate edits of video
		such as Green Screen shots exported as image sequences
		with an Alpha channel.

	env
		This will contain ENVironments made for the project. This would
		include Buildings, level blockouts or heightmaps for terrain.  
		In other words, any 3D asset which should be treated as a 
		static part of the scene (as opposed to CHARacters or PROPS which
		could potentially be animated or used to dress the ENVironment).
		The ENVirnonment can also be thought of as the Film Set or Film Location
		for the project.

	export
		This will contain EXPORTed versions of assets, either third party
		in the ASSET folder or created by the project team (CHARs, ENVs, PROPs)
		in a format suitable for importing or linking into the main project
		scene.  For example downloaded assets which aren't available in a format
		the main project scene can load would be converted to another format and
		saved in this folder to transfer to the main scene.  Also, any assets
		which need to be cached for use in the scene such as an animation cache
		of a CHARacter or a simulation can be baked into cache files stored in
		this folder.

	props
		This will contain PROPs which are any object created for the project
		which is not a character or part of the static environment.  This will
		be things such as furniture, vehicles etc for an urban environment or
		trees, rocks etc for an outdoors envirnoment.
